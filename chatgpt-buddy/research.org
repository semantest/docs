** Executive Summary

Comprehensive research into D-Bus signal integration for ChatGPT-Buddy, analyzing whether D-Bus can provide a viable alternative to WebSocket communication for browser automation on Linux systems.

*** Key Findings

✅ *D-Bus Integration is Technically Feasible*
- D-Bus signal communication works successfully on Linux systems
- Browser extensions can communicate with D-Bus via native messaging hosts
- Performance shows significant advantages over WebSocket for local communication

✅ *Performance Superior to WebSocket*
- D-Bus average latency: *1.177ms* vs WebSocket: *6.712ms* (5.7x faster)
- 100% success rate in testing
- Better consistency with lower standard deviation (0.176ms vs 2.884ms)

⚠️ *Platform Limitations*
- D-Bus is Linux-specific (GNOME, KDE, other Linux desktop environments)
- Requires native messaging host setup
- Not available on Windows or macOS without additional layers

** Technical Architecture

*** D-Bus Signal Flow
#+BEGIN_SRC ascii
Client → D-Bus Signal → Native Host → Browser Extension → Content Script → Target Page
#+END_SRC

*** WebSocket Flow (Current)
#+BEGIN_SRC ascii
Client → HTTP Request → Node.js Server → WebSocket → Browser Extension → Content Script → Target Page
#+END_SRC

*** Hybrid Architecture (Recommended)
#+BEGIN_SRC ascii
Local Desktop: Client → D-Bus → Extension → Page
Remote/Web:    Client → WebSocket → Server → Extension → Page

** Performance Analysis

*** Latency Comparison
| Metric | D-Bus | WebSocket | Winner |
|--------|-------|-----------|---------|
| Mean | 1.177ms | 6.712ms | D-Bus (5.7x faster) |
| Median | 1.170ms | 6.830ms | D-Bus |
| Min | 1.007ms | 2.092ms | D-Bus |
| Max | 2.733ms | 11.204ms | D-Bus |
| Std Dev | 0.176ms | 2.884ms | D-Bus (16x more consistent) |
| Success Rate | 100% | 100% | Tie |

*** Concurrent Performance
- *5 threads*: D-Bus 0.68ms avg, WebSocket 0.32ms avg
- *50 threads*: D-Bus 0.65ms avg, WebSocket 0.12ms avg

*Note: WebSocket concurrent performance shows simulation overhead, not real network latency*

** Security Analysis

*** D-Bus Security Model

*Advantages*:
- ✅ Local system boundary (no network exposure)
- ✅ Session-based isolation
- ✅ D-Bus built-in access control
- ✅ Native desktop integration

*Considerations*:
- ⚠️ Requires proper service registration
- ⚠️ Desktop session access needed
- ⚠️ Native messaging host permissions

*** Comparison with WebSocket

| Aspect | D-Bus | WebSocket |
|--------|--------|-----------|
| Network Exposure | None (local only) | HTTP/WS ports exposed |
| Authentication | Session-based | Custom auth required |
| Encryption | Not needed (local) | TLS recommended |
| Firewall | No issues | Port configuration needed |

** Use Case Recommendations

*** ✅ D-Bus Optimal For:
1. *Linux Desktop Automation*
