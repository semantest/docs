** Built on Proven Foundations

1. *TypeScript-EDA*: Event-driven architecture with @listen decorators
2. *Web-Buddy Framework*: Generic web automation infrastructure  
3. *Domain-Driven Design*: ChatGPT-specific business logic and events
4. *Hexagonal Architecture*: Clean separation of concerns

* Core Capabilities

** ChatGPT Automation

#+BEGIN_SRC typescript
import { ChatGPTBuddyClient } from '@chatgpt-buddy/client';

const client = new ChatGPTBuddyClient({
  serverUrl: 'http://localhost:3000'
});

// Project-based workflow
await client.selectProject('web-development');
const response = await client.askQuestion('Explain React hooks');

// File analysis
await client.uploadFile('/path/to/code.ts');
const analysis = await client.analyzeCode();

// Conversation management
const conversationId = await client.startNewConversation();
await client.switchToConversation(conversationId);
#+END_SRC

** Interactive Training

#+BEGIN_SRC typescript
// Start training mode
await client.startTrainingMode();

// User clicks in browser, system records actions
// Pattern automatically generated:
const pattern = {
  name: 'Code Review Workflow',
  steps: [
    { action: 'SELECT_PROJECT', selector: '#web-development' },
    { action: 'UPLOAD_FILE', selector: 'input[type="file"]' },
    { action: 'ASK_QUESTION', prompt: 'Review this code for best practices' }
  ]
};

// Execute learned pattern
await client.executePattern(pattern);
#+END_SRC

** Pattern Management

#+BEGIN_SRC typescript
// Share patterns with team
await client.sharePattern(pattern, {
  teamId: 'development-team',
  permissions: ['read', 'execute']
});

// Version tracking
const v2 = await client.updatePattern(pattern.id, {
  steps: [...pattern.steps, newStep]
});

// Pattern analytics
const metrics = await client.getPatternMetrics(pattern.id);
console.log(`Success rate: ${metrics.successRate}%`);
#+END_SRC

* Advanced Features

** Cross-Platform Communication

ChatGPT-Buddy supports multiple communication channels:

1. *WebSocket (Universal)*: Works on all platforms with excellent compatibility
2. *D-Bus (Linux)*: 5.7x better performance for Linux desktop integration

#+BEGIN_SRC bash
# Performance comparison
WebSocket average latency: 6.712ms
D-Bus average latency:    1.177ms

# D-Bus integration

// Training events
export class TrainingModeRequested extends Event { ... }
export class ElementSelected extends Event { ... }
export class PatternRecorded extends Event { ... }

// Automation events  
export class ProjectSelectionRequested extends Event { ... }
export class QuestionAsked extends Event { ... }
export class ResponseReceived extends Event { ... }

// Pattern management events
export class PatternShared extends Event { ... }
export class PatternExecuted extends Event { ... }
export class PatternValidated extends Event { ... }
