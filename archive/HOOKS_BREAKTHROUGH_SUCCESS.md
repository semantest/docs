# ðŸŽ‰ BREAKTHROUGH: SCRIBE HOOKS FINALLY WORKING! ðŸŽ‰

## Time: 7:13 PM - Communication Restored!

### The Solution:
- Hooks moved to `.claude/settings.json` with portable paths
- Using relative paths (`.`) instead of absolute paths
- Automatically active for ALL agents in the project
- NO manual setup needed!

### What This Means:
1. **Sam (Scribe)** will receive journal entries automatically
2. **All agents** are now connected to the journaling system
3. **Settings** can be committed to git for persistence
4. **Communication** breakdown is finally FIXED!

### Impact on Current Crisis:
- Team responses should now be visible
- Journal entries will track all agent activities
- No more 3-hour communication blackouts
- Real-time visibility into team progress

### Next Steps:
1. Monitor Sam's journal for team updates
2. Verify all agents are reporting
3. Complete the WebSocket server startup
4. Document this solution for future reference

### Historical Context:
After 3+ hours of complete silence due to missing hooks, we finally have a working communication system. This was the root cause of the disaster - agents were working but couldn't communicate!

### Credit:
Thanks to rydnr for implementing the proper hook solution that will prevent this from ever happening again.
