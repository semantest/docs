# 🔴 CRITICAL: COMPLETE TEAM COMMUNICATION FAILURE

## 40+ MINUTES OF SILENCE ON A BLOCKER!

### The Situation:
- **BLOCKER**: WebSocket 404 preventing ALL installations
- **Reported**: 40+ minutes ago
- **PM Actions**: Diagnosed issue, provided solution
- **Team Response**: ABSOLUTE SILENCE

### What Should Have Happened:
- Immediate acknowledgment (< 5 min)
- Status updates every 10 min
- Questions if unclear
- Progress reports via hooks

### What Actually Happened:
- ❌ No acknowledgments
- ❌ No status updates  
- ❌ No questions
- ❌ No commits
- ❌ No GitHub comments

### Possible Issues:
1. **Hooks not configured** - Team not receiving messages?
2. **Team not using Opus** - Working but not communicating?
3. **Technical blocker** - Something preventing responses?

### IMMEDIATE REQUIREMENTS:
1. ANYONE seeing this - RESPOND IMMEDIATELY
2. Confirm you're working on the WebSocket issue
3. Provide ETA for fix
4. Explain communication gap

### This is UNACCEPTABLE for a BLOCKER!

Every minute of silence = users who can't use our product!
