## Email 2: Feature Deep Dive (Day 3)

**Subject**: [First Name], the ChatGPT feature that saves me 2 hours every week
**Preview Text**: Quick video showing the template system that changes everything...

### Email Content

**Hi [First Name],**

Quick question: How many times did you type "Please help me debug this code" in ChatGPT this week?

If you're like most developers, it's probably 10-20 times. That's 30 minutes of repetitive typing that could be automated.

### ⚡ Meet Semantest Templates

Watch this 45-second demo: **[VIDEO THUMBNAIL]**

**Here's how it works:**

1. **Save any prompt as a template** (once)
2. **Organize by category** (Debug, Review, Document, etc.)
3. **Insert with one click** or keyboard shortcut
4. **Never type the same thing twice**

### 🎯 Real Templates from Real Users

**For Developers:**
```
Ctrl+D → "Debug this code and explain the issue:"
Ctrl+R → "Review this code for best practices:"
Ctrl+T → "Write unit tests for this function:"
```

**For Writers:**
```
Ctrl+E → "Edit for clarity and flow:"
Ctrl+S → "Summarize in 3 bullet points:"
Ctrl+G → "Generate 5 title options:"
```

**For Consultants:**
```
Ctrl+A → "Analyze this data and provide insights:"
Ctrl+P → "Create a project proposal based on:"
Ctrl+M → "Draft meeting notes from:"
```

### 📊 The Math is Simple

- Average prompt: 50 words
- Retyped daily: 5-10 times
- Time saved per week: 2+ hours
- Accuracy improvement: 100% (same prompt every time)

### 🎁 Bonus: Template Library

When you install Semantest, you also get:
- 25+ pre-built professional templates
- Industry-specific template packs
- Community template sharing (coming soon)
- Custom keyboard shortcuts

### 💡 But Wait, There's More...

Templates are just ONE of six game-changing features:
1. Smart folder organization
2. **Instant templates** ← We're here
3. Professional export (PDF/Word/Markdown)
4. Lightning search
5. Quick actions
6. Automatic backup

**Each feature saves hours. Together? They transform how you work.**

### ⚡ Still Free, Still Private

No trial periods. No premium upsells. No data collection.

Just pure productivity.

**[INSTALL SEMANTEST FREE →]**
*Join the 52,000+ professionals already saving time*

Tomorrow, I'll show you how one user organized 500+ ChatGPT conversations in 10 minutes.

Stay productive,

Founder, Semantest
