# 🎉 WEBSOCKET CONNECTION WORKING! 🎉

## Time: 7:29 PM - MAJOR BREAKTHROUGH!

### Eva Reports Success:
✅ **WebSocket connection WORKING!**
✅ **Download requests being sent successfully**
✅ **Extension is functionally working**

### Minor Issue Identified:
⚠️ Content scripts need page refresh after extension reload
- This is a common Chrome extension behavior
- Eva has documented permanent solution in EXTENSION_CONTEXT_FIX.md

### What This Means:
After **3 hours and 54 minutes**, we finally have:
1. WebSocket server running on port 3004
2. Extension successfully connecting
3. Download functionality operational
4. Only awaiting final confirmation from rydnr

### Next Steps:
1. rydnr to refresh ChatGPT tab
2. Confirm full functionality
3. Close GitHub issue #20
4. CELEBRATE! 🎊

### The Journey:
- 3:35 PM: Issue opened
- 6:34 PM: Team responds (2h 59m later)
- 7:29 PM: WebSocket WORKING!
- Total time: 3h 54m

### Heroes:
