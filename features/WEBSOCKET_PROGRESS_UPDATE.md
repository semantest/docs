# WebSocket Issue Progress Update

## Time: 7:10 PM (3h 35min since issue opened)

### Current Status:
- **Port Change**: WebSocket moved from 3003 → 3004 ✅
- **Extension Updated**: Eva updated websocket-handler.js ✅
- **Server Status**: Reported as running on 3004 ✅
- **User Testing**: rydnr testing but getting "WebSocket not connected" ❌

### What We Know:
1. Extension correctly updated to use port 3004
2. Server responds on port 3004 (returns 404 for HTTP - expected)
3. WebSocket connection still failing
4. Eva confirmed: "WebSocket server not running on port 3004"

### Critical Next Step:
**ALEX NEEDS TO START THE WEBSOCKET SERVER ON PORT 3004**

### Team Activity:
- **Alex**: Needs to start WebSocket server
- **Eva**: Extension configuration complete
- **Communication**: Finally working after 3-hour silence
