### Main Reddit Post Content

Hey r/ChatGPT! 👋

**TL;DR**: We built a free Chrome extension that adds folders, templates, search, and export to ChatGPT. It's in BETA with 50k+ users. Need your feedback!

**The Long Story:**

Like many of you, I was drowning in ChatGPT conversations. Important prompts lost in endless scroll. Rewriting the same templates. No way to organize projects. Sound familiar?

So we built **Semantest BETA** - a free Chrome extension that transforms ChatGPT into an actual workspace.

**🚧 BETA Features (All Stable):**
- 📁 **Folders** - Finally organize conversations by project/client/topic
- 📝 **Templates** - Save prompts once, reuse forever (with keyboard shortcuts!)
- 💾 **Export** - Turn conversations into PDFs, Word docs, or Markdown
- 🔍 **Search** - Find any conversation in seconds (it's FAST)
- ⚡ **Quick Actions** - One-click to summarize, translate, format
- 🔄 **Auto Backup** - Never lose conversations again

**🔒 The privacy part** (because I know you'll ask):
- 100% local storage - nothing leaves your browser
- No accounts, no tracking, no BS
- We literally can't see your conversations
- Open source components for transparency

**🚧 Why BETA?**
We've been testing with 50,000+ users for 6 months, but we want r/ChatGPT's input specifically. You folks push ChatGPT harder than anyone, so your feedback is invaluable.

**Current BETA status:**
- ✅ 95% stability rate
- ✅ 4.9★ from 2,800+ reviews
- ✅ Weekly updates based on feedback
- ✅ Core features production-ready

**It's completely free** (and will stay free). We just want to build something genuinely useful for the community.

**Chrome Web Store BETA link**: [Install Semantest BETA]

**Known BETA quirks:**
- Might need to refresh ChatGPT after install
- We're pushing updates weekly based on feedback
- UI is still being polished based on user input
- Some advanced features still in development

**What we're looking for from r/ChatGPT:**
- How you currently organize ChatGPT work
- Your biggest ChatGPT productivity pain points  
- Features that would save you the most time
- Feedback on the BETA experience

Drop feedback here, join our Discord (link in extension), or email beta@semantest.com. We actually read everything and implement user suggestions weekly.

Thanks for checking out the BETA! Happy to answer any questions.

**Edit**: Wow, this community is amazing! Answering questions below 👇

**Edit 2**: For those asking about Firefox - it's on our roadmap for Q2!

**Edit 3**: Yes, it works with ChatGPT free accounts! No API needed.

**Edit 4**: Discord link for BETA feedback: discord.gg/semantest-beta
```

### Comment Reply Templates

**For "Is it really free?"**
```
Yep, 100% free during BETA and core features stay free forever. No trials, no premium tiers (yet). We might add optional team features later, but everything you see now stays free. BETA users get locked-in pricing!
```

**For "How's it different from X?"**
```
Great question! Main differences: 1) Complete organization system (not just one feature), 2) Everything local for privacy, 3) Actually free during BETA, 4) Built specifically for ChatGPT workflows, 5) Active development with user feedback.
```

**For "Firefox/Safari?"**
```
Firefox is planned for Q2 2025 (BETA feedback is helping prioritize). Safari is trickier due to their extension limitations, but we're working on it. For now, it works on Chrome, Edge, Brave, Opera, and other Chromium browsers.
```

**For "BETA concerns?"**
```
Valid concern! BETA means active development, but core features are stable (95% uptime with 50k users). We push weekly updates based on feedback. Think "early access" rather than "unstable." You can always uninstall if issues arise!

### Personal LinkedIn Post (for founder/team)

**Text**:
```
🚀 Personal milestone: Today we launched Semantest BETA!

6 months ago, I was frustrated losing important ChatGPT conversations in endless scroll. I knew other professionals felt the same pain.

So our team built Semantest - a Chrome extension that adds organization, templates, search, and export to ChatGPT.

The response has been incredible:
• 50,000+ BETA users in 6 months
• 4.9★ rating from early adopters
• Users saving 2+ hours per week
• Community spanning 80+ countries

What I learned building this:
✅ Privacy isn't negotiable - everything stays local
✅ Free tools can be sustainable with the right model
✅ User feedback shapes great products
✅ Simple solutions often work best

The ChatGPT productivity space is exploding, but most tools are expensive or compromise privacy. We chose a different path.

Semantest BETA is free forever for core features. No catch.
