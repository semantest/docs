### Public Announcement Draft

**Title: Expanding Semantest: Your Voice Shapes Our Future**

Dear Semantest Community,

Today marks an important moment in our journey. While celebrating our browser extension launch with 50,000+ users, we've received clear feedback: many of you want CLI and SDK access.

**We hear you.**

**Current Reality:**
Semantest is a browser extension that enhances the ChatGPT web interface. It excels at visual organization, templates, and export features - all within your Chrome browser.

**Your Request:**
Command-line tools, programmatic access, and developer SDKs for workflow automation and integration.

**Our Response:**
We're officially adding CLI/SDK development to our roadmap. Your use cases are compelling:
- Automated ChatGPT workflows
- CI/CD pipeline integration  
- Programmatic conversation management
- Headless operation for servers
- API access for custom tools

**Timeline:**
- Now-Q1 2025: Gathering requirements from interested users
- Q2 2025: CLI beta program launch
- Q3 2025: SDK early access
- Q4 2025: Full API platform

**Get Involved:**
Join our CLI/SDK Advisory Group to shape these tools: cli-beta@semantest.com

**Meanwhile:**
Our browser extension continues to evolve with features that benefit all users. The export functionality (PDF/Markdown/Word) provides a bridge for current workflow integration.

Thank you for pushing us to think bigger.

The Semantest Team

## 4. MESSAGING THE GAP

### Honest Acknowledgment Strategy

**For Disappointed CLI Seekers:**
"We understand you were looking for CLI tools. While Semantest is currently a browser extension, your feedback has directly influenced our roadmap. Join our CLI beta list to be first when it launches."

**For Current Users:**
"You're using the foundation of something bigger. Today's browser extension is tomorrow's full platform."

**For Investors/Partners:**
"We've validated product-market fit with 50,000+ browser extension users. CLI/SDK demand confirms our platform expansion strategy."

### Bridge Messaging

**Current Workarounds:**
"While we develop native CLI tools, our browser extension's export feature (PDF/Markdown) enables basic workflow integration. Many users pipe exported Markdown into their existing CLI workflows."

**Value Proposition Pivot:**
- FROM: "Universal ChatGPT tool"
- TO: "Browser-first, expanding to CLI"

### Expectation Management

**Clear Communication Framework:**
1. ALWAYS lead with "browser extension"
2. MENTION Chrome/browser in first sentence
3. SHOW screenshots of web interface
4. CLARIFY installation process
5. ACKNOWLEDGE CLI interest and timeline

**Example Responses:**

*"Is this a CLI tool?"*
"Not yet! Semantest is currently a Chrome browser extension that enhances the ChatGPT web interface. Based on strong demand, we're developing CLI tools for Q2 2025. Want to join the beta?"

*"Can I use this in my Python scripts?"*
"Currently, Semantest works in your browser while using ChatGPT. We're building an SDK for programmatic access - join our beta list to influence its development!"

*"I need headless automation"*
"Our browser extension focuses on visual organization. For headless operation, we recommend joining our CLI beta waitlist. Your use case helps shape our development priorities."
