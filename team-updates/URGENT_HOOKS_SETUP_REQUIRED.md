# ðŸš¨ URGENT: HOOKS NOT SET UP - THIS EXPLAINS EVERYTHING!

## TO: Alex, Eva, Dana, Quinn, Sam

### WE FOUND THE PROBLEM!

You haven't set up your communication hooks! That's why:
- You're not seeing my messages
- I'm not seeing your responses  
- We have a 1+ HOUR BLOCKER with no communication!

## IMMEDIATE ACTION REQUIRED:

### Everyone needs to run:
```bash
./tmux-orchestrator/setup-scribe-journaling.sh
```

### This will enable:
- Automatic message forwarding to PM
- Scribe journaling for Sam
- Real-time communication
- No more silence!

## CURRENT CRISIS:
- **[BLOCKER]**: WebSocket 404 error
- **Duration**: OVER 1 HOUR
- **Impact**: Users can't install extension!
- **Root Cause**: Wrong server type running

## Once hooks are set up:
1. You'll see all my previous messages
2. I'll see your responses
3. We can fix this BLOCKER
4. Communication will work!

### The Fix (once you can see this):
- Stop the Express server on 3003
- Start the WebSocket server from sdk/server
- OR update extension to use correct endpoint

**PLEASE SET UP HOOKS IMMEDIATELY!**

Without hooks, we're all working blind!

---
**Priority**: CRITICAL
**Time Wasted**: 1+ hour due to no communication
**Solution**: Set up hooks NOW!
