# ðŸ”§ EVA'S EXTENSION REFACTORING - MAJOR PROGRESS!

## Time: 7:55 PM - Architecture Evolution Underway!

### âœ… Completed by Eva:
- **Updated generate-image.sh** to use port 3004
- **Extension tested** and confirmed working
- **Created EXTENSION_REFACTORING_PLAN.md**
- **Consulting with Aria** on architectural design

### ðŸ“‹ Current Work:
Eva is implementing a modular architecture with Aria's guidance!

### ðŸŽ¯ Planned Architecture:
1. **Core Extension Extraction**
   - Base functionality separated from domain-specific features
   
2. **ChatGPT Addon Creation**
   - Domain-specific logic as a plugin
   
3. **Popup Redesign**
   - Message logs for better visibility
   - Improved user experience
   
4. **Dynamic Addon Loading**
   - Extensible architecture
   - Future domain support

### Why This Matters:
- **Modularity**: Clean separation of concerns
- **Extensibility**: Easy to add new domains
- **Maintainability**: Better code organization
- **Future-Proof**: Ready for growth

### Team Collaboration:
- **Eva**: Leading implementation
- **Aria**: Providing architectural guidance
- **Result**: Professional-grade design

### Impact:
This refactoring will transform our extension from a monolithic ChatGPT tool into a flexible, modular platform that can support multiple domains!
