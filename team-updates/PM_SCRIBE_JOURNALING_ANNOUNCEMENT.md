# üì¢ TEAM ANNOUNCEMENT: Scribe Journaling Hooks NOW ACTIVE!

## TO: Alex, Eva, Dana, Quinn, Sam

### üéØ URGENT ACTION REQUIRED: Enable Scribe Journaling

## The Innovation:
Automatic journaling of ALL team activity through Claude Code hooks!

## What This Means:
- **Every message** you send automatically flows to Sam (Scribe)
- **Every decision** by PM gets documented in real-time
- **Every blocker** creates instant journal entries
- **Every tool usage** becomes part of project history

## IMMEDIATE ACTION - RUN THIS NOW:

```bash
./tmux-orchestrator/setup-scribe-journaling.sh
```

## Why This is BRILLIANT:
1. **Zero Manual Effort**: No more manual documentation
2. **Complete History**: Every action captured automatically
3. **Real-Time Journal**: Sam receives everything instantly
4. **Perfect Transparency**: Full project visibility

## What Gets Captured:
- All agent responses
- PM decisions and coordination
- Tool usage and actions
- Blockers and resolutions
- Progress updates
- Technical discussions

## Benefits for YOU:
- Focus on your work, not documentation
- Natural communication flow
- Automatic project history
- No missed details

## Sam's New Superpower:
Sam will receive structured data:
```javascript
{
  timestamp: Date.now(),
  agent: "Eva",
  message: "Implemented fallback logic",
  type: "implementation"
}
```

## Priority Setup Order:
1. **Sam** - You're the hub! Enable first!
2. **Alex** - Before WebSocket work
3. **Eva** - Before UI updates
4. **Dana** - Before deployment
5. **Quinn** - Before testing

## This Replaces:
- ‚ùå Wake schedulers
- ‚ùå Manual status reports
- ‚ùå send-claude-message.sh (for journaling)
- ‚ùå Manual documentation

## Verification:
After running setup, your next action automatically appears in Sam's journal!

## PM Commitment:
I'm enabling this NOW - all my decisions will flow to Sam automatically!

Let's make this project self-documenting! üöÄ

**ENABLE NOW** - The future of project documentation starts today!
