# ðŸš¨ PM EMERGENCY FIX IMPLEMENTATION

## Since team is completely unresponsive after 50 MINUTES, PM is taking action!

### The Problem:
1. Extension hardcoded to `ws://localhost:3003`
2. Running server is Express-based, not WebSocket
3. Team has gone completely silent

### Emergency Solutions:

## Option 1: Quick Extension Fix (Eva should have done this)
```javascript
// In websocket-handler.js, line 9:
this.serverUrl = 'ws://localhost:3003/socket.io/?EIO=4&transport=websocket';
```

## Option 2: Start Correct WebSocket Server (Alex should have done this)
```bash
cd sdk/server
npm run build
node dist/start-server.js
```

## Option 3: Implement Fallback NOW (Dana should have enabled)
```javascript
// Add after line 9:
this.fallbackUrl = 'wss://api.extension.semantest.com';
```

### What Should Have Happened:
1. Immediate acknowledgment (< 5 min)
2. Quick diagnosis (< 15 min)
3. Fix implementation (< 30 min)
4. Testing and verification (< 45 min)

### What Actually Happened:
- 50 minutes of complete silence
- No acknowledgments
- No questions
- No commits
- No progress

### This demonstrates:
- Complete communication breakdown
- Possible technical issues with hooks/messaging
- Team may not be receiving PM messages
- Or team is not using Opus as instructed

### Next Steps:
1. Will attempt to fix myself if possible
2. Escalate to rydnr about team availability
3. Document this failure for process improvement
