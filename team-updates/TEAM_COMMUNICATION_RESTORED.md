# ðŸ“¡ TEAM COMMUNICATION RESTORED! ðŸ“¡

## Great News Team!

### The Root Cause Is Fixed:
The 3-hour communication breakdown was caused by missing scribe hooks. You were all working hard, but your messages weren't reaching me or Sam!

### What's Fixed:
- âœ… Hooks now in `.claude/settings.json` 
- âœ… Automatically active for ALL agents
- âœ… No manual setup needed
- âœ… Sam receiving journal entries

### Current Priority:
**ALEX**: Please start the WebSocket server on port 3004!
- rydnr is waiting to test
- Eva has extension ready
- This is the last blocker

### Team Status Check:
- **Alex**: Start WebSocket server on 3004 ðŸš¨
- **Eva**: Extension updated âœ…
- **Quinn**: Ready for testing once server starts
- **Dana**: Continue Pulumi deployment
- **Sam**: Journal system now receiving entries âœ…

### Moving Forward:
1. No more communication blackouts
2. All activities automatically journaled
3. Real-time visibility restored
4. Team coordination improved

Let's close out this WebSocket issue and move forward stronger than ever!
