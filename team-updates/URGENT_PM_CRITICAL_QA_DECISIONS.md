# üö® URGENT: PM DECISIONS REQUIRED - TEST COVERAGE CRISIS üö®

**THIS REQUIRES IMMEDIATE PM ATTENTION**

## CRITICAL SITUATION
- **Current Test Coverage: 9.8%** (72 tests for 736+ files)
- **Eva just found WebSocket bug** that tests would have prevented
- **Production at risk** without immediate action

## 5 DECISIONS NEEDED TODAY:

### 1. RESOURCE ALLOCATION ‚è∞
**Can we dedicate 2-3 developers to testing for 1 month?**
- Option A: 3 devs full-time ‚úÖ (Recommended)
- Option B: 2 devs full-time
- Option C: 1 dev part-time ‚ùå (Insufficient)

### 2. MERGE POLICY üö¶
**Enforce "no merge without tests" starting NOW?**
- Option A: Yes, mandatory ‚úÖ (Recommended)
- Option B: Critical paths only
- Option C: Optional ‚ùå (Status quo failing)

### 3. TIMELINE üìÖ
**Accept 3 months to reach 80% coverage?**
- Month 1: 30%
- Month 2: 55%
- Month 3: 80% ‚úÖ (Recommended)

### 4. FEATURE PAUSE ‚è∏Ô∏è
**Pause features to focus on testing?**
- Option A: Full 2-week pause ‚úÖ (Recommended)
- Option B: 50/50 split
- Option C: Continue as-is ‚ùå (Too risky)

### 5. ENFORCEMENT üìã
**How to ensure compliance?**
- Option A: CI/CD gates + reviews ‚úÖ (Recommended)
- Option B: Weekly reports
- Option C: Trust-based ‚ùå (Not working)

## EVIDENCE OF RISK
- WebSocket bug: Port 8080 vs 3003 mismatch
- Broke production image generation
- Would have been caught by basic integration test

## NEXT STEPS
1. **PM decision required by EOD today**
2. **Implementation starts tomorrow**
3. **First milestone: 30% in 4 weeks**
