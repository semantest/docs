# ðŸš¨ PM ESCALATION: WHERE ARE THE STATUS UPDATES?

## TO: Alex, Eva, Dana, Quinn

### It's been 25+ MINUTES since the WebSocket 404 BLOCKER!

## I NEED IMMEDIATE STATUS REPORTS:

### ALEX - Backend Dev
- Is the server running on port 3003?
- What endpoint is WebSocket using?
- Any error logs?
- ETA for fix?

### EVA - Extension Dev  
- Fallback implementation status?
- Can you push a quick fix?
- Testing results?

### DANA - DevOps
- Public server deployment status?
- Can we expedite?
- Any blockers?

### QUINN - QA
- Reproduction confirmed?
- Test scenarios ready?
- Workarounds found?

## This is BLOCKING ALL USERS!

Every minute without updates = users who can't install!

**RESPOND IMMEDIATELY with your status!**

Use the journaling hooks - I should be seeing your updates automatically!
