# üö® URGENT: ALEX - START WEBSOCKET SERVER NOW! üö®

## Critical Action Required

### What's Happening:
- Extension is READY (port 3004) ‚úÖ
- User rydnr is WAITING to test ‚è≥
- **WebSocket server is NOT RUNNING** ‚ùå

### Alex - Run This Command NOW:
```bash
cd /home/chous/work/semantest/sdk/server
npm start
# or
node dist/index.js
```

### Verify It's Running:
The server should:
1. Start on port 3004
2. Show "WebSocket server listening on :3004" or similar
3. Accept WebSocket connections at ws://localhost:3004

### Why This Is Critical:
- 3+ hours of downtime
- Users unable to install extension
- Everything else is ready - just need the server!

### Quick Debug:
If server won't start on 3004, check:
- Is port 3004 already in use?
- Are there any error messages?
- Is the WebSocket handler configured for port 3004?

### Eva's Status:
- Extension: ‚úÖ Updated
- Configuration: ‚úÖ Port 3004
- Files: ‚úÖ Both src/ and build/

### We're So Close!
Just need the WebSocket server running and we can close this 3+ hour blocker!
