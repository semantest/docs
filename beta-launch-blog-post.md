# 🚀 Semantest for ChatGPT BETA is Live: Transform Your AI Workspace Today

**The most comprehensive ChatGPT organization tool enters public beta with 50,000+ users already boosting productivity by 10x**

---

After 6 months of intensive development and testing with over 50,000 beta users, we're thrilled to announce that **Semantest for ChatGPT BETA** is now publicly available in the Chrome Web Store!

If you've ever lost an important ChatGPT conversation in endless scroll, rewritten the same prompt for the hundredth time, or wished you could organize your AI work like a professional—this moment is for you.

## The Problem We're Solving

ChatGPT has revolutionized how we work, learn, and create. But as it becomes central to our daily workflows, we've hit a wall: **ChatGPT lacks basic organization features**.

Professional users face the same frustrations daily:
- 📜 **Endless scrolling** through conversation history
- 🔄 **Retyping identical prompts** multiple times per day
- 🗂️ **No way to organize** projects or clients
- 📄 **Can't export professional outputs** for sharing
- 🔍 **No search functionality** across conversations
- ⏰ **30% of ChatGPT time wasted** on navigation and repetition

That's why we built Semantest—to transform ChatGPT from a simple chat interface into a professional workspace.

## Introducing Semantest BETA: 6 Game-Changing Features

### 1. 📁 Smart Folder Organization
**Finally, organize your ChatGPT conversations like a pro.**

Create unlimited folders and subfolders to organize by:
- Client projects
- Personal vs. professional work
- Topics and research areas
- Team collaborations
- Learning subjects

**Drag-and-drop functionality** makes organizing effortless. No more hunting through hundreds of conversations—everything has its place.

*BETA Note: Cross-device sync coming in full release*

### 2. 📝 Instant Prompt Templates
**Save your best prompts once, use them forever.**

Build a library of reusable prompts with:

```

*BETA Note: Template sharing features in development*
