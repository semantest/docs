### Main Post

Hey r/ChatGPT! 👋

Like many of you, I was drowning in ChatGPT conversations. Important prompts lost in endless scroll. Rewriting the same templates. No way to organize projects. Sound familiar?

So we built **Semantest** - a free Chrome extension that transforms ChatGPT into an actual workspace.

**What it does:**
- 📁 **Folders** - Finally organize conversations by project/client/topic
- 📝 **Templates** - Save prompts once, reuse forever (with keyboard shortcuts!)
- 💾 **Export** - Turn conversations into PDFs, Word docs, or Markdown
- 🔍 **Search** - Find any conversation in seconds (it's FAST)
- ⚡ **Quick Actions** - One-click to summarize, translate, format

**The privacy part** (because I know you'll ask):
- 100% local storage - nothing leaves your browser
- No accounts, no tracking, no BS
- We literally can't see your conversations

**Why we're here:**
We've been testing with 50,000+ users, but we want r/ChatGPT's input specifically. You folks push ChatGPT harder than anyone, so your feedback would be invaluable.

**It's completely free** (and will stay free). We just want to build something genuinely useful for the community.

**Chrome Web Store link**: [Install Semantest BETA]

**Known BETA quirks:**
- Might need to refresh ChatGPT after install
- We're pushing updates weekly based on feedback
- UI is still being polished

Would love to hear what features you'd want most. We're especially interested in:
- How you currently organize ChatGPT work
- Your biggest ChatGPT productivity pain points  
- Features that would save you the most time

Drop feedback here or join our Discord (link in extension). We actually read everything and implement user suggestions weekly.

Thanks for checking it out! Happy to answer any questions.

**Edit**: Wow, front page! Thanks for all the feedback. Answering questions below 👇

**Edit 2**: For those asking about Firefox - it's on our roadmap for Q2!

**Edit 3**: RIP inbox 😅 If I missed your question, feel free to email beta@semantest.com

### Comment Replies Ready

**For "Is it really free?"**
> Yep, 100% free. No trials, no premium tiers (yet). Core features will always be free. We might add optional team features later, but everything you see now stays free forever.

**For "How does it make money?"**
> It doesn't (yet). We're focused on building something useful first. Eventually might add optional team/enterprise features, but individual features stay free. Think Zoom's model.

**For "Privacy concerns?"**
> Totally valid concern! Everything is local browser storage. We have no servers that store your data. You can check our code - key parts are open source. We can't see your conversations even if we wanted to.

**For "Firefox/Safari?"**
> Firefox is planned for Q2 2025. Safari is trickier due to their extension limitations, but we're working on it. For now, it works on Chrome, Edge, Brave, and other Chromium browsers.

**For "What makes this different from X?"**
> Good question! Main differences: 1) Complete organization system (not just one feature), 2) Everything local (privacy-first), 3) Actually free (no sneaky limits), 4) Built specifically for ChatGPT workflows.

**For "Can I export all conversations?"**
> Currently one at a time, but bulk export is our #2 requested feature. Coming in the next few weeks!

**For "Mobile support?"**
> Not yet, but it's high on our roadmap. Chrome mobile doesn't support extensions well, so we're exploring other options.

### Alternative Shorter Version

**Title**: 
```
Made a free Chrome extension to organize ChatGPT - folders, templates, search. Need beta testers!
```

**Post**:

Hey r/ChatGPT!

Got tired of losing important ChatGPT conversations, so I built a Chrome extension that adds:
- Folders to organize chats
- Reusable prompt templates  
- Export to PDF/Word/Markdown
- Instant search across all conversations
- Quick actions (summarize, translate, etc)

It's 100% free and stores everything locally (privacy-first).

50k people are using it, but I'd love feedback from this community since you're the real ChatGPT power users.
