## Review Response Guidelines

### Providing Feedback

#### Good Feedback ‚úÖ

```typescript
// Consider using a more specific type instead of string
// This would provide better type safety and prevent invalid values
type OrderStatus = 'pending' | 'processing' | 'completed' | 'cancelled';
```

```typescript
// This could lead to a memory leak if the component unmounts
// before the timeout completes. Consider:
useEffect(() => {
  const timer = setTimeout(() => setData(newData), 1000);
  return () => clearTimeout(timer);
}, [newData]);
```

#### Poor Feedback ‚ùå

```
// This is wrong
// Fix this
// Bad code
```

### Categorizing Comments

- **üî¥ Must Fix**: Bugs, security issues, or violations of requirements
- **üü° Should Fix**: Important improvements that should be addressed
- **üü¢ Consider**: Suggestions for better practices or minor improvements
- **üí° Nitpick**: Style preferences or very minor issues
- **‚ùì Question**: Clarification needed to understand the code
- **üëè Praise**: Highlighting good practices or clever solutions

## Approval Criteria

### Approval Requirements

1. **No Blocking Issues**: All üî¥ Must Fix items resolved
2. **Tests Pass**: CI/CD pipeline green
3. **Coverage Maintained**: Code coverage not decreased
4. **Documentation Complete**: All public APIs documented
5. **Security Cleared**: No security vulnerabilities

### When to Request Changes

- Critical bugs or security issues
- Missing required tests
- Violations of architecture principles
- Performance regressions
- Incomplete implementation

### When to Approve with Comments

- Minor issues that can be fixed in follow-up
- Style preferences
- Suggestions for future improvements
- Non-critical optimizations

## Review Efficiency Tips

1. **Review in Passes**
   - First pass: Overall architecture and approach
   - Second pass: Implementation details
   - Third pass: Tests and documentation

2. **Use Tools**
   - IDE/Editor integration for inline comments
   - Linting results to catch style issues
   - Coverage reports to verify testing

3. **Time Management**
   - Limit review sessions to 60-90 minutes
   - Review smaller PRs more frequently
   - Focus on high-risk areas first

4. **Communication**
   - Ask questions rather than make assumptions
   - Suggest alternatives with examples
   - Acknowledge good practices

## Post-Review Actions

### For Reviewers

- [ ] Re-review after significant changes
- [ ] Approve when all criteria met
- [ ] Follow up on merged PRs if needed

### For Authors

- [ ] Address all comments (fix or respond)
- [ ] Update PR description with changes made
- [ ] Request re-review after changes
- [ ] Thank reviewers for their time

## Special Considerations

### Large PRs

- Consider breaking into smaller PRs
- Review commit-by-commit
- Focus on architecture first
- Schedule dedicated review time

### Urgent Changes
