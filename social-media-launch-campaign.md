Hey Product Hunters! 👋

After seeing how chaotic ChatGPT conversations can get, we built Semantest to bring order to the chaos.

What started as a simple folder system evolved into a comprehensive workspace solution thanks to 50,000+ beta testers who shaped every feature.

We're especially proud of:
- Sub-0.3s search (it's FAST)
- Zero data collection (privacy first!)
- Free forever model (productivity for all)

Ask me anything about building privacy-first Chrome extensions, ChatGPT productivity, or our journey from 0 to 50k users!

What ChatGPT workflow problems do you face? We're already planning v2 based on community feedback.
